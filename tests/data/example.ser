No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.</p>

<p>A few notes about the sections above:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames</li>
<li>"Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin</li>
<li>"Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on</li>
<li>"Tested up to" is the highest version that you've <em>successfully used to test the plugin</em>. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.</li>
<li><p>Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use <code>/trunk/</code> for
stable.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>readme.txt</code> of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the <code>/trunk/readme.txt</code> file says that the stable tag is <code>4.3</code>, then it is <code>/tags/4.3/readme.txt</code> that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk <code>readme.txt</code>
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk <code>readme.txt</code> to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's <code>readme.txt</code> points to the correct stable tag.</p>

<p>If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.</p></li>
